## Chat-App (No official name yet)

**Client:** React, JS, CSS

**Server:** Node, Express, Nodemailer


## Description
This is a project that represents my undergraduate thesis!
This project is a similar copy of WhatsApp.

Is not done yet.

## Demo

Using this link : https://chat-app-license.vercel.app/ you can see a demo of this project, thanks to Vercel !


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Andrei6700/Chat-App-License
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Chat-App-License
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the project
```bash
  npm start
```

Go to the server directory

```bash
  cd backend
```
Start the server
```bash
  nodemon serverMailSender.js
```

For the server I used **XAMPP** where I started ``MySQL`` and ``Apache``
## Usage

 
In order to adapt this project to the configuration you have in your firebase, you need to add it to the :  `src\firebase\firebase.js`
```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";

const firebaseConfig = {
// Your web app's Firebase configuration
};

export const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth();
export const storage = getStorage();
export const db = getFirestore();
export const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

```
 And to be able to send mails you have to replace in this path:`backend\config.js` with your mail and password, or you can use https://ethereal.email/ for test

```javascript
module.exports = {
  USER: '', // email
  PASS: ''  // password
};
```
### Reminder 
Make sure that **YOU** after ``editing config.js`` put it in ``.gitignore``

## Optimizations

Optimizations, hmmm. 
I assure you that if you have over a nvidia gtx 1650 goes, give and much RAM :))) that eats a lot 


## Features
‚úÖ Light/dark mode toggle at:

   - ‚úÖ sign up page (not 100%)
   - ‚ùå log in page
   - ‚úÖ chat page


‚úÖCommunication between 2 people

‚úÖAdding a person and searching for him/her

‚úÖusing a YUP scheme to validate sign up pages

‚ùå Video call using Firebase + WebRTC

‚õî voicemail, oh hell nah, I don't think so

‚úÖ send mail to the user who made an account 

## Bugs
Off too many üò•

‚ùå responsive problems when the screen is small:

- all sizes below this (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 767.98px) will contain page : ``blanlPage.jsx``  does not allow interaction with the chat

- sizes below (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) will increase the input corruption of the chat page leaving an empty space

- users testing the chat page on their phone will not be able to interact with the input

- images submitted are placed on the center or made as "full page"

‚ùå the user who chooses to put a video instead of an avatar image will only see it

‚ùå the first message containing the date of all messages sent that day is too close to the chatInfo div

‚ùå and more :((

## Lessons Learned

What I have learned throughout the course of doing this project for my thesis is that I will not, I don't think I will, be a programmer. I enjoyed working on this project, I still do, but that vibe, but I see too many errors, my motivation has dropped extremely, extremely low, I'm facing problems that are easily done for others (now I know, but ANYONE has compared or compares themselves to others), that I've spent a month or more on.

When I try to do something it gives me error, I also browse sometimes at ChatGPT which also put me in depression but at the same time it takes me out of that state a bit but puts me in another one, as mno it's my degree work and it's considered that I only worked on it, whatever.

I was able to learn new stuff, I really recommend anyone to try to do such a project as mno you run into a lot of problems. Mostly I liked working on the frontend, now I'm kinda sorry I didn't take so much time to make it better and responsive for all devices.
I'm glad that server attempt with XAMPP works, I tried to make an account on heroku to put the backend but I failed in creating the account.

If you put me to do this project would I still do it? The answer would be yes and no, but if it's to do it without being able to get inspiration from somewhere I wouldn't be able to do it, that's why I'm left with the thought that I'm not meant to be a programmer, I'm parallel to this field, honestly I'm wondering how I'm an Info student.
